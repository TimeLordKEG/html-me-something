	<h2>About Shark Jesus</h2>
		<p>SharkJesus gives us gills with which to swim the seas of life. All hail His Biteyness.</p>
		<p>Welcome to the Temple of SharkJesus. We are a religion which worships the divine Megalodon. We also honor your inner Megalodon.</p> 
		<p>By your gills, may you be freed, to shake your flippers just the way you want to be!</p>
		<p>He dived for our fins.</p>
