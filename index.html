	<h2>About Shark Jesus</h2>
		<p>SharkJesus gives us gills with which to swim the seas of life. All hail His Biteyness.</p>
		<p>Welcome to the Temple of SharkJesus. We are a <i>puntastic</i> religion which worships the divine Megalodon. We also honor your inner Megalodon.</p> 
		<p>By your gills, may you be freed, to shake your flippers just the way you want to be!</p>
		<p>He dived for our fins.</p>

		<p>Ah-Fin. </p>

	<h3>The Message of the Acolybites</h3>
		<p>In the beginning, there was a seven-day war amongst all the Jesuses: SharkJesus, Tiny Jesus, Buddy Christ, the Flying Spaghetti Monster, and of course Elvis. 
		   As the blood and carnage dragged on SharkJesus dove deep under the sea.  He communed with the urchins, seaweed, and the reefer.  
		   On the third day, he arose from the surf and decided that all their love should be shared with human-kind.
		   So he did the only thing he could; he swallowed them whole â€¦ which is why his breath smells of marinara.  Even though SharkJesus loved us all, many humans were tricked by the deception of the devious serpent SharkSatan.  
		   They forced SharkJesus to walk into the desert while dragging an anchor wearing nothing more than a crown of six-pack rings.  Even after human-kinds betrayal, SharkJesus loved us.  
		   He promised that his love will swallow us whole.  And we should not shun the nonbelievers, for they populate the beaches and feed Him!</p>
		   <p>As a member of his shoal, we ask:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Have you met our friend, SharkJesus?</li>
			<li>He dived for our fins.</li>
			<li>His porpoise cannot be undone.</li>
			<li>He is the wave, the tooth, and the lifeboat.</li>
			<li>Let they free from fin cast the first line.</li>
			<li>He is the prawn before the squall.</li>
			<li>Though I swam through the reef in the shallows of depth, I will fear no eels.</li>
			<li>His cod is an awesome cod.</li>
			<li>Do not flounder in your work for SharkJesus!</li>
			<li>Be voracious and take big bites out of life!</li>
			<li>He frowns on shellfishness.</li>
			<li>Thou shall not krill!</li>
			<li>Be a good blowfish and you, too, can earn 72 urchins.</li>

		<h4>The Temple of Shark Jesus is a theme camp at regional Burning Man events for both <a href="http://midwestburners.org/">Midwest Burners</a> &amp <a href="http://gatewayburners.org/"</a>Gateway Burners.</a></h4>  
		<p> These events are focused on the ten principles of Burning Man with the addition of an 11th principle - Consent.
			<dl>
				<dt>Radical Inclusion</dt>
				<dd>Anyone may be a part of a Burn. We welcome and respect the stranger. No prerequisites exist for participation in our community.</dd>
				<dt>Gifting</dt>
				<dd>Burns are devoted to acts of gift giving. The value of a gift is unconditional. Gifting does not contemplate a return or an exchange for something of equal value.</dd>
				<dt>Decommodification</dt>
				<dd>In order to preserve the spirit of gifting, our community seeks to create social environments that are unmediated by commercial sponsorships, transactions, or advertising. We stand ready to protect our culture from such exploitation. We resist the substitution of consumption for participatory experience</dd>
				<dt>Radical Self-Reliance</dt>
				<dd>Burns encourage the individual to discover, exercise and rely on his or her inner resources.</dd>
				<dt>Radical Self-Expression</dt>
				<dd>Radical self-expression arises from the unique gifts of the individual. No one other than the individual or a collaborating group can determine its content. It is offered as a gift to others. In this spirit, the giver should respect the rights and liberties of the recipient.</dd>
				<dt>Communal Effort</dt>
				<dd>Our community values creative cooperation and collaboration. We strive to produce, promote and protect social networks, public spaces, works of art, and methods of communication that support such interaction.</dd>
				<dt>Civic Responsibility</dt>
				<dd>We value civil society. Community members who organize events should assume responsibility for public welfare and endeavor to communicate civic responsibilities to participants. They must also assume responsibility for conducting events in accordance with local, state and federal laws.</dd>
				<dt>Leave-No-Trace</dt>
				<dd>Our community respects the environment. We are committed to leaving no physical trace of our activities wherever we gather. We clean up after ourselves and endeavor, whenever possible, to leave such places in a better state than when we found them.</dd>
				<dt>Participation</dt>
				<dd>Our community is committed to a radically participatory ethic. We believe that transformative change, whether in the individual or in society, can occur only through the medium of deeply personal participation.
We achieve being through doing. Everyone is invited to work. Everyone is invited to play. We make the world real through actions that open the heart.</dd>
				<dt>Immediacy</dt>
				<dd>Immediate experience is, in many ways, the most important touchstone of value in our culture. We seek to overcome barriers that stand between us and a recognition of our inner selves, the reality of those around us, participation in society, and contact with a natural world exceeding human powers.
No idea can substitute for this experience.</dd>
