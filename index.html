		<p>We are a <i>puntastic</i> religion which worships the divine Megalodon. We also honor your inner Megalodon.</p> 
		<p>SharkJesus gives us the gills with which to swim the seas of life. All hail His Biteyness.</p>
		<p>By your gills, may you be freed, to shake your flippers just the way you want to be!</p>
		<p>He dived for our fins.</p>

		<h3>The Temple of SharkJesus is a sound camp at regional Burning Man events<br>for both <a href="http://midwestburners.org/">Midwest Burners</a> &amp <a href="http://gatewayburners.org/">Gateway Burners.</a></h3>
		<p class="d"> We provide much more than multiple genres of music to dance and worship with.<br>  We also offer flesh marinades - a fragrant and refreshing mud bath that nourishes your skin.<br> If you feel inspired by SharkJesus and want to forever live in his watery graces, his love will "swallow" you whole in baptisim.<br>
			There are minions to be found all throughout the burns working to bring "soles" into to SharkJesus' loving bite.   
		<p class="d"> These events are focused on the ten principles of Burning Man with the addition of an 11th principle - Consent.

	<h2>The Message of the Acolybites</h2>
		<p class="a">In the beginning, there was a seven-day war amongst all the Jesuses: SharkJesus, Tiny Jesus, Buddy Christ, the Flying Spaghetti Monster, and of course Elvis.<br>
		   As the blood and carnage dragged on, SharkJesus dove deep under the sea.  He communed with the urchins, seaweed, and the reefer.<br>
		   On the third day, he arose from the surf and decided that all their love should be shared with human-kind.<br>
		   So he did the only thing he could; he swallowed them whole â€¦ which is why his breath smells of marinara.<br><br>  Even though SharkJesus loved us all, many humans were tricked by the deception of the devious serpent SharkSatan.<br> 
		   They forced SharkJesus to walk into the desert while dragging an anchor wearing nothing more than a crown of six-pack rings.<br>  Even after human-kinds betrayal, SharkJesus loved us.  
		   He promised that his love will swallow us whole.  <br>And we should not shun the nonbelievers, for they populate the beaches and feed Him!</p>

		  <p>As a member of his shoal, we ask:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Have you met our friend, SharkJesus?</li>
			<li>He dived for our fins.</li>
			<li>His porpoise cannot be undone.</li>
			<li>He is the wave, the tooth, and the lifeboat.</li>
			<li>Let they free from fin cast the first line.</li>
			<li>He is the prawn before the squall.</li>
			<li>Though I swam through the reef in the shallows of depth, I will fear no eels.</li>
			<li>His cod is an awesome cod.</li>
			<li>Do not flounder in your work for SharkJesus!</li>
			<li>Be voracious and take big bites out of life!</li>
			<li>He frowns on shellfishness.</li>
			<li>Thou shall not krill!</li>
			<li>Be a good blowfish and you, too, can earn 72 urchins.</li>
