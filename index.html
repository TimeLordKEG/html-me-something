	<h2>About Shark Jesus</h2>
		<p>SharkJesus gives us gills with which to swim the seas of life. All hail His Biteyness.</p>
		<p>Welcome to the Temple of SharkJesus. We are a <i>puntastic</i> religion which worships the divine Megalodon. We also honor your inner Megalodon.</p> 
		<p>By your gills, may you be freed, to shake your flippers just the way you want to be!</p>
		<p>He dived for our fins.</p>

		<p>Ah-Fin. </p>
		
	<h3>The Message of the Acolybites</h3>
		<p>In the beginning, there was a seven-day war amongst all the Jesuses: SharkJesus, Tiny Jesus, Buddy Christ, the Flying Spaghetti Monster, and of course Elvis. 
		   As the blood and carnage dragged on SharkJesus dove deep under the sea.  He communed with the urchins, seaweed, and the reefer.  
		   On the third day, he arose from the surf and decided that all their love should be shared with human-kind.
		   So he did the only thing he could; he swallowed them whole â€¦ which is why his breath smells of marinara.  Even though SharkJesus loved us all, many humans were tricked by the deception of the devious serpent SharkSatan.  
		   They forced SharkJesus to walk into the desert while dragging an anchor wearing nothing more than a crown of six-pack rings.  Even after human-kinds betrayal, SharkJesus loved us.  
		   He promised that his love will swallow us whole.  And we should not shun the nonbelievers, for they populate the beaches and feed Him!</p>
		   <p>As a member of his shoal, we ask:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Have you met our friend, SharkJesus?</li>
			<li>He dived for our fins.</li>
			<li>His porpoise cannot be undone.</li>
			<li>He is the wave, the tooth, and the lifeboat.</li>
			<li>Let they free from fin cast the first line.</li>
			<li>He is the prawn before the squall.</li>
			<li>Though I swam through the reef in the shallows of depth, I will fear no eels.</li>
			<li>His cod is an awesome cod.</li>
			<li>Do not flounder in your work for SharkJesus!</li>
